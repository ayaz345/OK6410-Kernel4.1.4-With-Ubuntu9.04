<h1>Conkeror Tutorial</h1>

<h3>Welcome to Conkeror</h3>

<p>
  The first thing you need to know about Conkeror is how to read key
  notation.  Each key combination is written as a hyphenated list of
  modifiers and key.  The codes for the common modifiers are as
  follows: <code>C</code> means Control; <code>M</code> means Meta or
  Alt; and <code>S</code> means Shift.  Therefore the key combination
  <code>C-M-f</code> means to hold down Control and Meta and press
  <code>f</code>.
</p>

<p>
  The key to scroll down is <code>C-n</code>.  The key to scroll up is
  <code>C-p</code>
</p>

<p>
  Many commands in Conkeror are run by typing a sequence of two or
  more key combinations.  The notation is simple.  Each combination in
  the sequence is written, in order, separated by spaces.  The
  sequence <code>C-h t</code> means to press Control-h, release all
  keys, then press <code>t</code>.  <code>C-h t</code> is the key
  sequence to view this tutorial.
</p>

<p>
  The key sequence to exit conkeror is <code>C-x C-c</code>.
</p>

<p>
  <code>C-g</code> is the abort key.  It is used to cancel a command
  from the minibuffer, or stop a web page from loading.
</p>

<p>
  <code>Space</code> and <code>Backspace</code> scroll a page down and
  a page up, respectfully.
</p>


<h3>Hinting</h3>

<p>
  The system for interacting with the elements of a document is called
  the hinting system.  With the hinting system, you can do things like
  follow hyperlinks, copy URLs, focus form fields, and more.  Let's
  use the hinting system to follow a hyperlink.  You will receive
  instructions about how to return here after you follow the
  hyperlink.  Scroll so that following numbered list and the hyperlink
  after it are both visible.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Press <code>f</code>.  (mnemonic: follow)</li>
  <li>The hyperlink should be hilighted, with a number on the left
  side.  Type that number.</li>
</ol>


<a href="chrome://conkeror/content/back-forward.html">This is a
hyperlink.</a>

<p>
  As a matter of fact, in addition to following links by number, you
  can also follow them by a substring of the link text.  You could
  follow the link above by typing <code>f t h i s</code>.  When more
  than one link with similar text is in view, hinting will narrow down
  the choices as you type.  You can always specify the one you want by
  disambiguating the sequence with the hint number.
</p>

<p>
  But hinting is for more than just hyperlinks.  Conkeror provides
  several <em>hint classes</em> for operating on different types of
  elements.  The hint class is specified by typing the corresponding
  key sequence of the class before the key sequence of the command.
  It was not necessary to specify a hint class for following the
  hyperlink above because links are the default hint class for the
  follow command.  The following table lists the most common hint
  classes.
</p>

<table>
  <tr><td><em>key</em></td><td><em>hint class</em></td><td><em>mnemonic</em></td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>n</code></td><td>links and form elements</td><td>liNk</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>i</code></td><td>images</td><td>Image</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>m</code></td><td>frameset frames and top window</td><td>fraMe</td></tr>
  <tr><td><code>* M</code></td><td>MathML nodes</td><td>Math</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
  The <code>c</code> key is bound to a command to copy an URL to the
  clipboard.  Its default hint class is links.  To copy the URL of the
  page you are currently browsing, you use the frameset link class.
  The top level window with or without a frameset is always number 0
  (zero).  On this tutorial page, you can type <code>m c</code> to
  copy the current URL.  You do not need to type 0 because this is not
  a frameset document.  If this were a frameset document, you would
  type <code>m c 0</code>.
</p>

<p>
  To have Conkeror prompt you for an URL and navigate there, type
  <code>g</code>.  The mnemonic is "go".  A similar command,
  <code>find-alternate-url</code>, is called with the sequence
  <code>C-x C-v</code>.  When find-alternate-url prompts you for an
  url, the prompt will be pre-filled with the url of the current
  buffer, so you can edit it.
</p>

<h3>Copying Text</h3>
<p>
  Gecko has a feature called caret browsing that gives you a blinking
  cursor that you can move and select document text with the keyboard.
  To enter caret browsing mode in Conkeror, press <code>C-q F7</code>.
  Select text by holding shift while pressing arrow keys.  Exit caret
  browsing mode by pressing <code>C-q F7</code> again.  Press
  <code>M-w</code> to copy the selection to the clipboard.
