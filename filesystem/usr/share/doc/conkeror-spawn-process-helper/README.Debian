conkeror for Debian
-------------------

The conkeror package is split up into two packages:

+ conkeror including all the non-architecture-specific files. This
  package is sufficient to run conkeror but you may not be able to
  spawn external commands like editors, etc.

+ conkeror-spawn-process-helper including the helper binary
  spawn-process-helper
